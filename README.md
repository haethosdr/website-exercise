the current project is an attempt at creating a full webpage, with found 
images, utilizing all html and css skills up to this point.

The skills i will have demonstrated upon completing this project are:
using css cascades to shape the webpage and add style, arranging content 
around the page with precision, adding creative touches to the project 
which are wholly my choice and taste, finding information on the web of 
which i havent yet been taught,and envisioning the proper approach to 
building a layout.
